# DLAI_3
First we use flowise to connect chatmodels to a chat bot, such that we copy and use the code in visual code.
Next we interact the API key of chatGPT 3.5 turbo into the code.
Then we train the model on world data bank data to gather GDP data for the worlds countries, so that we can ask the model different quistions to this dataset.
Then finaly we copy the streamlit template made by Hamid, and intergrate our chatbot into the app.
The bot can now answer quistions within this data, but cannot answer quistions outside of it, because we have not trained it on other datasets.
